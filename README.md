# Accounting Service Website

Project by Stephen Collins

Landing page and informational site for fictitious accounting firm Stratford Accounting

Hosting link: https://swcollins462.github.io/accounting-service-website/

Page design and images taken from a template at canva.com.
Site features a striking landing page followed by a responsive multi-column layout. Site uses:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   a modal window
-   a form utilizing formspree.io
